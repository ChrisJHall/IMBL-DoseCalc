# IMBL-DoseCalc
Beamline dose rate and flux density calculator.

This small GUI provides ionisation chamber current, monochromatic photon flux density, and air KERMA dose rate in a linked algorithm.
An input into any of the three text boxes will result in a calculation of the other two quantities.
Version 1.0 has a fixed photon energy (40 keV), a fixed beam area (15 mm bt 15 mm) and a fixed electron loss correction.
Future releases will allow these to be varied.
